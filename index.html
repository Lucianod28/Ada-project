<h1>Summary</h1>

Grocery shopping is an integral part of all of our lives. We rely on the grocery store to fulfill out nutrition, health, and other needs. Due to the ubiquity of this activity, we wondered what we could learn from people's shopping habits.

We used the <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/careers/engineering/sourcefiles">Dunnhumby dataset</a> to look for interesting shopping patterns. Specifically, we mainly used the "Complete Journey" dataset, which contains data about household shopping habits from over 2,500 households over 2 years. This dataset contains information about when transactions took place, which items were bought, household demographics, and more. We also used their "Breakfast at the Frat" dataset, which contains information about discounts for a smaller sample of products.
